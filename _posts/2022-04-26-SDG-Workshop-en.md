The meeting reviewed the stages of implementation of the 2030 Agenda in the Kyrgyz Republic and the current state of the national system for monitoring and reporting SDG indicators.

First Deputy Chairman Orozbayeva A.J. noted that Kyrgyzstan was one of the first in the region to successfully develop an effective SDG monitoring system and implement international data and metadata exchange standards (SDMX). To date, the National Statistical Committee collects data for 102 global and 57 national SDG indicators with available disaggregation.

Members of the interdepartmental working group exchanged views on improving the SDG monitoring system, and also noted the importance of interaction and communication for the SDGs.

During the meeting, the interdepartmental working group discussed and adopted an updated national set of SDG indicators. Also discussed was the draft Roadmap previously reviewed by government agencies to strengthen the statistical capacity of the Kyrgyz Republic to monitor the Sustainable Development Goals, which will be the main document determining the development of SDG statistics in Kyrgyzstan.
