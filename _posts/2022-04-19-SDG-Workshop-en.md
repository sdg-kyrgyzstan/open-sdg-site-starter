The meeting reviewed and discussed the current state of the national system for monitoring and reporting SDG indicators, issues of improving the Open SDG KG platform, the introduction of a new tool UN ESCAP SDG Tracker.

First Deputy Chairman Orozbayeva A.J. noted that Kyrgyzstan was one of the first in the region to successfully develop an effective SDG monitoring system and implement international standards for data and metadata exchange (SDMX). Today, the National Statistical Committee collects data for 102 global and 57 national SDG indicators with accessible disaggregation. All data and metadata (methodology) of indicators are posted on the national SDG reporting platform of the Kyrgyz Republic - Open SDG KG in machine-readable formats such as SDMX, csv, xml.

During the meeting, the working group members discussed and adopted an updated national set of SDG indicators. The draft Roadmap on strengthening the statistical capacity of the Kyrgyz Republic for monitoring the Sustainable Development Goals, which was previously considered in the NSC, was also discussed, which will be the main document defining the development of SDG statistics in Kyrgyzstan.
