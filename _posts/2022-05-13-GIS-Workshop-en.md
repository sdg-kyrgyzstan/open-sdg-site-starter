The National Statistical Committee of the Kyrgyz Republic, within the framework of building a national monitoring and reporting system for indicators of the Sustainable Development Goals, will hold a technical seminar on the use of geospatial information for calculating indicators of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) from May 11 to 13, 2022. The seminar was organized with the assistance of the UN Statistics Division and the Central Statistical Office of Norway.

The purpose of the technical seminar is to increase the statistical capacity of ministries and departments of the Kyrgyz Republic to calculate new SDG indicators using a geospatial information system, namely, the proportion of rural population living within 2 km of an all-season road (SDG 9.1.1), as well as: the ratio of land use rates to population growth rates (SDG 11.3.1) using geospatial data.

It should be noted that in Kyrgyzstan, calculations of statistical indicators based on data from non-traditional sources will be made for the first time.
