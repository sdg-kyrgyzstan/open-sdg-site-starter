On June 26-27, 2023, the National Statistical Committee of the Kyrgyz Republic is holding a seminar “Statistics of the Sustainable Development Goals” with the support of the German Society for International Cooperation (GIZ).

The seminar is aimed at increasing the capacity of specialists from government agencies of the Kyrgyz Republic in the field of understanding, interpretation, calculation and use of indicators of the Sustainable Development Goals. The seminar is attended by representatives of the Ministry of Economy and Commerce, the Ministry of Education and Science, the Ministry of Labor and Social Security and Migration, the Ministry of Health and other government bodies.

Chairman of the National Statistical Committee Kudaibergenov B.Zh. noted that among the main targets for the National Statistics Committee is the construction of an effective monitoring and reporting system for the SDGs and the provision of complete, high-quality and reliable data for a wide range of statistics users. Statistics provide objective information about various aspects of social life and the economy, which helps the republic's leadership analyze the situation and develop policies based on evidence.
Experience has shown that there is a need to improve statistical literacy among users of statistical information and this seminar is one of the first steps in this area.
