The National Statistical Committee of the Kyrgyz Republic, in collaboration with the UN Women Regional Office, held a presentation of the publication “Sustainable Development Goals and Gender in the Kyrgyz Republic”.

The purpose of the event was to inform representatives of government agencies, civil society, academia, and international organizations about the current status and progress in the areas of sustainable development and gender equality, in order to support evidence-based policy and decision-making within the framework of SDG implementation and the empowerment of women and girls.

The Chairperson of the National Statistical Committee, Baktybek Kudaibergenov, addressed the participants, emphasizing that the Committee places particular importance on the production of gender statistics as a key tool for assessing progress towards achieving gender equality in the country.
"We are living in an era of digitalization, where statistics and data play a crucial role in evidence-based policy and decision-making for sustainable development. Improving the collection of gender-disaggregated data is one of the priorities of the National Strategy for the Development of Official Statistics until 2030," he noted.

The Representative of UN Women in the Kyrgyz Republic, Ulziisuren Jamsran, delivered welcoming remarks to the participants and commended the strong collaboration between the National Statistical Committee and UN Women in the development, production, and dissemination of gender data.

The Regional Data Advisor of the UN Women Regional Office for Europe and Central Asia, Ala Negrutsa, spoke about the importance of gender statistics in planning, data collection, and policymaking aimed at addressing gender issues and achieving gender equality.

The event also included discussions on issues such as violence against women and girls, unpaid domestic work, women's employment levels, and their participation in decision-making processes.
