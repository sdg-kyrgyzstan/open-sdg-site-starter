The Kyrgyz Republic reaffirms its strong commitment to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are systematically integrated into national policy frameworks, including the long-term National Sustainable Development Strategy (2018–2040) and the National Development Programme until 2026. Priority is placed on advancing human well-being, improving quality of life, and fostering inclusive and sustainable economic growth. The Kyrgyz Republic fully supports the global pledge to «leave no one behind,» with particular attention to the needs of vulnerable and marginalized populations.

The Second Voluntary National Review (VNR) of the Kyrgyz Republic addresses 16 of the 17 SDGs, with Goal 14 (Life Below Water) deemed less applicable due to the country’s landlocked geography. The VNR was developed through an inclusive and participatory process involving government entities, civil society organizations, and development partners. It outlines national approaches, identifies progress and challenges, and highlights priority areas for accelerated implementation.
