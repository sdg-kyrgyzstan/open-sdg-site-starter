This publication was prepared by the National Statistical Committee of the Kyrgyz Republic with the support of the UN Women Regional Office for Europe and Central Asia as part of the Making Every Woman and Girl Count program to improve gender data and statistics.

The publication uses data from official statistics, departmental statistics, as well as the results of the Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) conducted in 2014 and 2018. The main emphasis is placed on the analysis of available indicators disaggregated by sex, age, level of education and income, as well as the place of residence of women and men. The data are presented for five years - from the year of the adoption of the SDGs and at the end of 2021. For the analysis of long-term trends, in some cases, statistical data for 2010 are given.
